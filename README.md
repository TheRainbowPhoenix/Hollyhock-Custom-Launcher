# Hollyhock Custom Launcher

A ClassPad-style launcher for the Casio ClassPad II, with app details and touch and keypad controls. **Version 0.6.2** is available for HH2 and HH3. An OS 7003 build is configured as a CI artifact (not yet a tagged release; available after a successful workflow run).

| Your installation | Apps | Download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HH3 · OS 02.01.7002.0001** | `.hh3` | [HH3 package](https://github.com/Loewenkrieger/Hollyhock-Custom-Launcher/releases/download/v0.6.2/hhk3-launcher-0.6.2-os7002.zip) |
| **HH3 · OS 02.01.7003.0000** | `.hh3` | [CI artifact `launcher-hh3-7003`](https://github.com/TheRainbowPhoenix/Hollyhock-Custom-Launcher/actions/workflows/build.yml) (unreleased) |
| **HH2 · OS 02.01.2000.0000** | `.hhk`, `.hh3`, compatible `.bin` | [HH2 package](https://github.com/Loewenkrieger/Hollyhock-Custom-Launcher/releases/download/v0.6.2/hhk2-launcher-0.6.2-os2000.zip) |

HH2 recognizes all three extensions regardless of case. HH3 apps must support your installed OS version. **Use the launcher binary matching your exact OS**; OS 7002 and 7003 have different function addresses. OS 7003 currently uses the native return dialog rather than the OS 7002-only silent-return hook.

## Install

1. Download the package for your installed Hollyhock and OS version.
2. Back up your existing `run.bin`, then replace it with the one from the package. Copy your apps to the root directory too.
3. Safely eject the calculator, disconnect USB and open the launcher as usual.

## Use

Choose an app from the dropdown and tap **Run**. **Close**, **X** or **Clear** closes the launcher. You can also use the arrow keys and **EXE**.

Your five most recently launched apps appear at the top with a **\***. The last app is selected automatically, and your history is saved between sessions.
